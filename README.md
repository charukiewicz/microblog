flask microblog
============

### Intro

I've made a simple API with the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) before (check out [beer manager](https://github.com/charukiewicz/beer-manager)), but I have never learned to use Flask to make an entire website including views, forms, a login system, and so on.

To do this, I am following Miguel Grinberg's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), as it goes into great detail on exactly how to get a simple blog up and running.
